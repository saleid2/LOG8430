STEP 1: DEPENDENCIES
1. In order to run the server, you must have Python 2.7.
The following requirements are needed for the server, and can be installed through PIP for Python 2.7:
 - Flask (latest version): pip install flask
 - requests (latest version): pip install requests
 - pyspark (2.3.2): pip install pyspark==2.3.2
 - numpy (latest version): pip install numpy
 - pymongo (latest version): pip install pypmongo
 
 2. In order to run the client, you must have Python 3
  The following requirements are needed for the client, and can be installed through PIP for Python 3
  - requests (latest version): pip install requests
 
 3. Additional requirement:
 Install a local MongoDB server for testing purposes.

 4. Enter MongoDB information in server_config.py
 
 5. This app is compatible with Spark 2.3.x, not with Spark 2.4.x.
 Install Apache Spark on Ubuntu using this tutorial :

 STEP 2: RUN MONGODB
 1. Open a terminal console.
 2. Use the following command: mongo log8430 (to initialize the mongo database)
 
 STEP 3: RUN THE SERVER ITSELF
 1. Go to the root of this project (RESTservice) and run the server: python ./serv.py
 2. When serv.py is running (that means Spark is too!):
  (If you followed the tutorial above correctly $SPARKHOME links to /usr/local/spark)
 3. We need to launch TWO local slaves:
 3.1 To do so, copy the file spark-env.sh into "/usr/local/spark/conf"
 3.2 Use the following command to launch a slave: 
		sudo $SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-slave.sh <spark-master-URL>
	 In this case, spark-master-URL is: spark://localhost:7077
		sudo $SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-slave.sh spark://localhost:7077

STEP 4: RUN THE CLIENT
1. Go to the root of this project (RESTservice) and run the client: 
	python3 ./client.py <server-ip-address>:<port>
By default, we run :
	python3 ./client.py 127.0.0.1:5000
2. Follow the instructions on-screen to add receipts to the database.

STEP 5: GET THE MOST FREQUENT PRODUCTS
1. Go to the root of this project (RESTservice) and run the client: 
	python3 ./client.py <server-ip-address>:<port> 1
By default, we run :
	python3 ./client.py 127.0.0.1:5000 1
2. Appreciate the magic of Spark and Polytechnique education!
